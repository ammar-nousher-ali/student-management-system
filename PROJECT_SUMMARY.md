## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- **React 18** with TypeScript for type safety

- **React Router** for client-side routing
- **Axios** for HTTP requests with interceptors
- **Context API** for global state management

## API Integration

The frontend is designed to work with your Go backend and expects these endpoints:

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration

### Students
- `GET /api/students` - Get all students
- `GET /api/students/:id` - Get student by ID
- `POST /api/students` - Create new student
- `PUT /api/students/:id` - Update student
- `DELETE /api/students/:id` - Delete student
- `GET /api/students/search?q=query` - Search students

### Dashboard
- `GET /api/dashboard/stats` - Get dashboard statistics

## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd student-management-frontend
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Access the Application**
   Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

4. **Connect to Backend**
   Ensure your Go backend is running on `http://localhost:8080`

## Customization Options

### Styling
- Modify the theme in `App.tsx` to change colors and styling
- Update Material-UI component props for different looks
- Add custom CSS for specific components

### API Configuration
- Update API base URL in `src/services/api.ts`
- Modify request/response interceptors as needed
- Add new API endpoints following the existing pattern

### Features
- Add new dashboard widgets
- Implement additional student fields
- Add export functionality (PDF, Excel)
- Implement bulk operations

## Mock Data

The application includes mock data for demonstration purposes:
- Sample students for the list view
- Dashboard statistics
- Recent students list

This allows you to see the UI in action even without a connected backend.

## Next Steps

1. **Connect to Your Backend**: Update the API endpoints to match your Go backend
2. **Customize Styling**: Adjust colors, fonts, and layout to match your brand
3. **Add Features**: Implement additional functionality as needed
4. **Testing**: Add unit tests and integration tests
5. **Deployment**: Build and deploy to your hosting platform

## Support

The application is built with modern React best practices and should be easy to maintain and extend. All components are well-documented and follow consistent patterns.
